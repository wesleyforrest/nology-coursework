    <h1>About Me......</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p>Having failed miserably to pass pigeon holing 101, I opted for a more varied and stimulating career path covering a wide variety of industries and skillsets. <br> 
        Had I been a superhero, I am less a Batman (charming but mundane career, bat eared crimefighter by night) and more “onionman”, a roundish character which at first comes across as rather course. <br>  
        Move past first impressions though and introduce to other ingredients (team members), all those layers of skill such as PM/engineer/ broadcaster/logistic genius and now full stack development empresario*  may infuse with those around to create a truely exquisite mix of skills and experience. <br>  
        Given the opportunity, I aim to use my broad skills to enhance your team, creating one of the best around.  This isnt just a tesco team, this isnt even the cardigan clad M&S of teams, this could be a full blown triple michelin star team.
